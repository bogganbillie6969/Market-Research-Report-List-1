<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interlining Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fusible interlining</li><li>Non Fuse Interlining</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The interlining materials market is categorized into two main types: fusible and non-fusible interlining. Fusible interlining is designed with an adhesive coating that bonds to the fabric when heat is applied, providing structure and support while allowing for easy application. In contrast, non-fusible interlining relies on stitching or weaving for attachment, making it suitable for delicate fabrics where adhesion may not be desirable. Both types cater to various textile applications, enhancing garment quality and longevity.</p></p>
