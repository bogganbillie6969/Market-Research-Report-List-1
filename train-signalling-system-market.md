<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Train Signalling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Block ATC System</li><li>Moving Block ATC System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The **Fixed Block ATC System** divides railway tracks into predefined sections (blocks), with trains maintaining safe distances based on block occupancy. It relies on track circuits or sensors to detect train positions, ensuring safety but limiting capacity due to fixed block lengths. The **Moving Block ATC System** dynamically adjusts train spacing based on real-time speed and location, using continuous communication. This system maximizes track capacity and efficiency, allowing trains to operate closer together while maintaining safety through advanced automation and data processing.</p></p>
