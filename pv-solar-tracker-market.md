<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Solar Tracker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-axis</li><li>Dual axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PV solar tracker market is primarily divided into two types: single-axis and dual-axis trackers. Single-axis trackers rotate on one axis, typically aligned north-south, optimizing solar energy capture throughout the day. They are more cost-effective and easier to install than dual-axis systems. In contrast, dual-axis trackers adjust on both horizontal and vertical axes, allowing them to follow the sun’s path more precisely, maximizing energy production. This makes dual-axis systems ideal for areas with varying sunlight conditions, though they are more complex and expensive.</p></p>
