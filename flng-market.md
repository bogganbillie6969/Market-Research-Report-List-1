<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FLNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LNG FPSO</li><li>FSRU</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The FLNG market primarily comprises two types: LNG FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) and FSRU (Floating Storage and Regasification Unit). LNG FPSOs facilitate the offshore production, liquefaction, and storage of natural gas, enabling efficient transport to global markets. In contrast, FSRUs convert liquefied natural gas back into gaseous form for distribution onshore. Both units enhance flexibility and scalability in the LNG supply chain, addressing growing energy demands while reducing infrastructure investments and minimizing environmental impact.</p></p>
