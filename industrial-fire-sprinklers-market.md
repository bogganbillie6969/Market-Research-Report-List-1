<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Fire Sprinklers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Sprinkler</li><li>Wet Sprinkler</li><li>Deluge Sprinkler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial fire sprinkler market comprises three primary types: dry, wet, and deluge sprinklers. Wet sprinklers contain water under pressure in pipes, allowing for immediate activation during a fire. Dry sprinklers, on the other hand, hold pressurized air and only release water when activated, making them ideal for cold environments. Deluge sprinklers are unpressurized and open, dispersing large volumes of water rapidly over large areas, typically used in high-hazard environments. Each type serves specific industrial fire protection needs.</p></p>
